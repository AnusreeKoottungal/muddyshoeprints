        <p>Hello! I am Anusree, an ambivert who loves books, food and travel. I love to live my life in its raw, unadulterated, imperfect form free from any sugar coatings which often reflects in my choice of books and places (but never food!). </p>
<p>
I also have a partner in crime, John, and we’ve been busy getting our shoes muddy with all those wanderings for quite some time now.  So that’s what this whole blog is about – the adventures our muddy shoes took us to!</p>
