        Hello! I am Anusree, an ambivert who loves books, food and travel. I
        love to live my life in its raw, unadulterated, imperfect form - free
        from any sugar coatings which often reflects in my choice of books and
        places (but never food!).
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also a software engineer and I've built this website from scratch.
        Most of the photos used in the posts came from my camera. Some of them
        are from the kind souls at <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">Pexels</a>.
      </p>

        I also have a partner in crime - John, and we’ve been busy getting our
        shoes muddy with all those wanderings for quite some time now. So that’s
        what this whole blog is about – the adventures our muddy shoes took us
        to!
