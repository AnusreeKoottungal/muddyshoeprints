      content:
        "Being a place that get a lot of tourists round the year, it’s easy to be in Bali and miss the local flavours – as most crowded spots will have restaurants that specifically target the trendy foreign crowd. Needless to say, the authenticity of what you might get served is often highly questionable, as they are often tampered to suit the western taste buds. " +
        "More often than not, these are ridiculously overpriced too.</p> We once got into a such a restaurant on our way to Munduk and found the prices in the menu almost ten times more expensive than the places we usually chose to eat from. Luckily, we were specifically looking for a dish that they didn’t happen to serve, so we left without ordering anything. " +
        "</p>So if you are looking for the unadulterated taste of the island, below’s where you should eat.",

          content:
            "We always make it a point to eat where the locals eat whenever possible while traveling. The reason is simple – you get authentic flavours which are not altered to please the tourists’ palate. And also, you would only have to pay a fraction of what it would cost you in the restaurants that cater to tourists.</p>" +
            "In Bali, small food stalls or “Warung”s are where you could get your best share of local deliciousness. An added advantage here is you get to have interesting conversations with the native people, something which is next to impossible when you eat at a place that is crawling with tourists.</p>" +
            "Most of the warungs we ate at were incredibly hygienic, and food was almost always fresh. There were a couple of questionable ones too, but both John and I can eat from a pit and not get sick so we weren’t much bothered about it. If you have a sensitive stomach, choose your warungs wisely. Also, look out for places which are usually crowded as you will most likely get fresh food.</p>" +
            "Apart from being authentic and cheap, there is another reason why I highly recommend Warungs. The money you pay here goes directly to the local community without any middlemen. Most warungs are the sole means of income to families that run them, and whatever we pay makes a huge difference in their lives. Also, to see their faces light up when you complement the food, is priceless.",

            "Indomaret and Alfamart are the most popular super market chains in Bali. You could find one or both of these at almost every little town. We noticed that the prices of goods vary from place to place though – unlike in India, most of the products don’t come with the price printed on them. You will have to look for the prices displayed on the shelves.</p>" +
            "A huge plus for these supermarkets is that they have seating areas in front of them where you could sit down and have the food you just bought. They also provide clean restrooms for customers’ use, which are otherwise often hard to find while traveling. Some of them also provide hot water for cooking instant noodles. So if you need to take a break and sip some iced tea while on a long bike ride, you know where to stop.",

            "Though the history of the place could be traced back to as early as the beginning of the Common Era, 15th century is said to be the Golden era of Hampi and Vijayanagara. Art and trade flourished under the reign of the then-emperor Krishna Devaraya. Hampi acquired such great riches that it is believed gold, pearls and diamonds were traded in open markets and stored in unlocked rooms.</p>" +
            "It was during this time, most of the palaces and temples in Hampi were built – heightening its glory. It is rumoured that Hampi had 2000 temples and 4000 mandapas, counting big and small.</p>" +
            "But the good times didn’t last very long. Hampi was attacked and conquered by the Deccan Sultanate during the 16th century. Hampi’s army was outnumbered and defeated. The treasures were looted, temples were burnt and people fled with their lives from the capital. The only temples which remained unscathed from the attack are the ones which worshipped lord Siva – and there is no unified theory on why they were spared. Some believe it was because these temples didn’t contain any lootable wealth and some argue that the Sultanate was unfamiliar with the Siva Linga to identify it as an idol.</p>" +
            "After about half a year of the attack, the Sultanate retired from Hampi, taking all its wealth along. Hampi was deserted. For centuries, it remained abandoned and forgotten. Hampi, once the traders’ paradise, became home to a jungle. Meanwhile, Tungabhadra flooded several times burying most of Hampi’s architecture marvels.</p>" +
            "It wasn’t until 19th century Hampi was remembered and re-found. Hampi’s ruins were surveyed by Colonel Colin McKenzie in 1800. The excavation and restoration is still going on and it is believed that there is a lot more left to uncover under the sands of Hampi.",

It must be the luggage we carried which gave us away- the moment we set foot on the platform, an auto-rickshaw driver came to us and asked whether we needed a ride to Hampi. The fare he quoted for the 13 km ride was ₹250, which we found reasonable. Off we go, in the tuk-tuk.</p>" +

The ferry is to cross the river Tungabhadra, to the other side of Hampi. Most of the restaurants and stays are across the river, as most of the Hampi side belongs to the archaeology department of India. We had our room reservations at Gowri Resorts and we had to take the ferry.</p>" +

The structure was in ruins, abandoned even in midst of the busy street. What remained was only a small portion of the palace, and it perhaps only retained the shadows of its ancient beauty.

We were astounded to see Lakshmi ‘blessing’ each one of them by splashing water on them with her trunk.</p>" +

As we stepped in, a guy with a badge approached us and introduced himself as Krishna, an authorised guide from the tourism department. He was conducting a guided tour in bicycles, covering some of the major ruins in Hampi. It costed ₹400 per head including the bicycle’s rent for the entire day. We signed ourselves up for it, and Krishna agreed to meet us again near the temple entrance in 15 minutes. We went inside to explore the temple in the meantime.</p>" +
            "The temple is a huge one, with numerous idols of deities inside. As we walked on, a little boy in a school uniform invited us to see the magic shadow in a dark room. Wondering what he meant, we followed him to find an inverted shadow of the temple tower on one of the walls. The only light source to the room was from a small, half-brick sized hole. It must be the pinhole camera effect, but mystery attracts a bigger crowd than science does.</p>" +
            "We walked back to the temple entrance to find Krishna waiting for us with three more people who had signed up for the tour. He started with the history of Hampi which you can read in my previous posts. </p>" +

When the decision was made, gold (Hema in Kannada) was showered upon the hill, thus naming it.</p>" +

The idol was named Kadalekalu Ganesha, meaning peanut Ganesh, as the shrine was built by a peanut merchant. The idol, gloriously illuminated by the sunlight in an otherwise dark room, left us awestruck.</p>" +
            "It just took us a couple of minutes in the bicycle from there to reach the shrine of Sasivekalu (mustard) Ganesha, which got named after the mustard merchant who built it. Unlike that of Kadalekalu Ganesha, the shrine here was an open one, built like a mandapa. Broken tusk in his hand and his tummy tied using a snake hinted that this monolithic idol represented Lord Ganesha, just after he tripped and fell while returning from a feast, as the myths say.</p>" +
