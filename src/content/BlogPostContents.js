    content:
      "Being a place that get a lot of tourists round the year, it’s easy to be in Bali and miss the local flavours – as most crowded spots will have restaurants that specifically target the trendy foreign crowd. Needless to say, the authenticity of what you might get served is often highly questionable, as they are often tampered to suit the western taste buds. " +
      "More often than not, these are ridiculously overpriced too.</p> We once got into a such a restaurant on our way to Munduk and found the prices in the menu almost ten times more expensive than the places we usually chose to eat from. Luckily, we were specifically looking for a dish that they didn’t happen to serve, so we left without ordering anything. " +
      "</p>So if you are looking for the unadulterated taste of the island, below’s where you should eat.",

          content:
          "We always make it a point to eat where the locals eat whenever possible while traveling. The reason is simple – you get authentic flavours which are not altered to please the tourists’ palate. And also, you would only have to pay a fraction of what it would cost you in the restaurants that cater to tourists.</p>" +
          "In Bali, small food stalls or “Warung”s are where you could get your best share of local deliciousness. An added advantage here is you get to have interesting conversations with the native people, something which is next to impossible when you eat at a place that is crawling with tourists.</p>" +
          "Most of the warungs we ate at were incredibly hygienic, and food was almost always fresh. There were a couple of questionable ones too, but both John and I can eat from a pit and not get sick so we weren’t much bothered about it. If you have a sensitive stomach, choose your warungs wisely. Also, look out for places which are usually crowded as you will most likely get fresh food.</p>" +
          "Apart from being authentic and cheap, there is another reason why I highly recommend Warungs. The money you pay here goes directly to the local community without any middlemen. Most warungs are the sole means of income to families that run them, and whatever we pay makes a huge difference in their lives. Also, to see their faces light up when you complement the food, is priceless.",

          "Supermarkets are treasure troves when it comes to local food hunting. You can get an array of regional fruits, snacks and other packaged food from there, and again, you won’t be ripped off for being a foreigner as the prices are fixed.</p>" +
          "Indomaret and Alfamart are the most popular super market chains in Bali. You could find one or both of these at almost every little town. We noticed that the prices of goods vary from place to place though – unlike in India, most of the products don’t come with the price printed on them. You will have to look for the prices displayed on the shelves.</p>" +
          "A huge plus for these supermarkets is that they have seating areas in front of them where you could sit down and have the food you just bought. They also provide clean restrooms for customers’ use, which are otherwise often hard to find while traveling. Some of them also provide hot water for cooking instant noodles. So if you need to take a break and sip some iced tea while on a long bike ride, you know where to stop.",
