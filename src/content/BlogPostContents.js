    content:
      "Being a place that get a lot of tourists round the year, it’s easy to be in Bali and miss the local flavours – as most crowded spots will have restaurants that specifically target the trendy foreign crowd. Needless to say, the authenticity of what you might get served is often highly questionable, as they are often tampered to suit the western taste buds. " +
      "More often than not, these are ridiculously overpriced too.</p> We once got into a such a restaurant on our way to Munduk and found the prices in the menu almost ten times more expensive than the places we usually chose to eat from. Luckily, we were specifically looking for a dish that they didn’t happen to serve, so we left without ordering anything. " +
      "</p>So if you are looking for the unadulterated taste of the island, below’s where you should eat.",

          "We always make it a point to eat where the locals eat whenever possible while traveling. The reason is simple – you get authentic flavours which are not altered to please the tourists’ palate. And also, you would only have to pay a fraction of what it would cost you in the restaurants that cater to tourists.</p>" +
          "In Bali, small food stalls or “Warung”s are where you could get your best share of local deliciousness. An added advantage here is you get to have interesting conversations with the native people, something which is next to impossible when you eat at a place that is crawling with tourists.</p>" +
          "Most of the warungs we ate at were incredibly hygienic, and food was almost always fresh. There were a couple of questionable ones too, but both John and I can eat from a pit and not get sick so we weren’t much bothered about it. If you have a sensitive stomach, choose your warungs wisely. Also, look out for places which are usually crowded as you will most likely get fresh food.</p>" +
          "Apart from being authentic and cheap, there is another reason why I highly recommend Warungs. The money you pay here goes directly to the local community without any middlemen. Most warungs are the sole means of income to families that run them, and whatever we pay makes a huge difference in their lives. Also, to see their faces light up when you complement the food, is priceless.",

          "Indomaret and Alfamart are the most popular super market chains in Bali. You could find one or both of these at almost every little town. We noticed that the prices of goods vary from place to place though – unlike in India, most of the products don’t come with the price printed on them. You will have to look for the prices displayed on the shelves.</p>" +
          "A huge plus for these supermarkets is that they have seating areas in front of them where you could sit down and have the food you just bought. They also provide clean restrooms for customers’ use, which are otherwise often hard to find while traveling. Some of them also provide hot water for cooking instant noodles. So if you need to take a break and sip some iced tea while on a long bike ride, you know where to stop.",

It can be the eagerness of an excitement of stepping into the no-man’s land where I always dreamt to be at. Next stop, Hosepete – where our adventure begins to unfold.</p>"+
          "Bags – check. Gadgets – check. Shoes on, we are out of the train. It must be the luggage we carried which gave us away- the moment we set foot on the platform, an auto-rickshaw driver came to us and asked whether we needed a ride to Hampi. The fare he quoted for the 13 km ride was ₹250, which we found reasonable. Off we go, in the tuk-tuk.</p>"+
          "We had to stop by an ATM vestibule, as only very few places in Hampi accept plastic. The driver asked whether he should drop us near the ferry terminal or the bazaar. The ferry is to cross the river Tungabhadra, to the other side of Hampi. Most of the restaurants and stays are across the river, as most of the Hampi side belongs to the archaeology department of India. We had our room reservations at Gowri Resorts and we had to take the ferry.</p>"+
          "Which is why when the driver told us there are no ferries there now, we had a mild panic attack. If there is no ferry, we would have to take a longer route which spans about 30 km.</p>"+
          "Before I could roll my eyes at John on his admirable trip planning skills, the driver speaks again</p>"+
          "‘The river is almost dry in the summer. You could just cross it by foot.’</p>"+
          "Well, crossing Tungabhadra by foot is definitely something I could add to my ‘look-what-I-did-in-Hampi’ list.</p>"+
          "‘Tuk-tuking’ from Hospete to Hampi was mostly through barren lands and a few villages. There were a handful remains of ancient structures – probably temples – on the road. When we finally reached ferry point, the driver made a ‘generous’ offer to take us around as a tour guide for Rs.1500. The offer was too generous to accept, we took his number though.</p>"+
          "Tungabhadra was mostly dry, naked, showing out her inner rocks with a few strands of streams that remained. A stretch of stone stairs lead us to the river where a lot of pilgrims were around swimming and splashing."

Gagan Mahal – an ancient palace which was believed to be built and used by Vijayanagara’s rulers around 16th century – was perhaps the jewel in the crown. The structure was in ruins, abandoned even in midst of the busy street. What remained was only a small portion of the palace, and it perhaps only retained the shadows of its ancient beauty. But Gagan mesmerized us nonetheless. The Mahal was all empty and it had developed a certain level of eeriness and haunted aura over the centuries through it was sleeping.</p>"+
